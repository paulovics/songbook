{\nolyrics Intro: \[F#m] \[D] \[A] \[E]}
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#m]I'm tired of being what you wan\[D]t me to be
\[A]Feeling so faithless, lost \[E]under the surface
\[F#m]Don't know what you're expe\[D]cting of me
Put \[A]under the pressure of \[E]walking in your shoes
\endverse

\beginverse
\echo{\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow}
Every \[F#m]step that I take is a\[A]nother mistake to you
\echo{\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow}
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F#m]I've become so \[D]numb
I can't feel you \[A]there
Become so \[E]tired
So much more a\[F#m]ware
I'm becoming \[D]this
All I want to \[A]do
Is be more like \[E]me
And be less like \[F#m]you
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[F#m]Can't you see that you're smo\[D]thering me
\[A]Holding too tightly, a\[E]fraid to lose control?
\[F#m]'Cause everything that you tho\[D]ught I would be
Has \[A]fallen apart ri\[E]ght in front of you
\endverse

\beginverse
\echo{\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow}
Every \[F#m]step that I take is a\[A]nother mistake to you
\echo{\[D]Caught in the undertow, just \[E]caught in the undertow}
And every \[F#m]second I waste is more than \[A]I can take
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F#m]I've become so \[D]numb
I can't feel you \[A]there
Become so \[E]tired
So much more a\[F#m]ware
I'm becoming \[D]this
All I want to \[A]do
Is be more like \[E]me
And be less like \[D]you
\endchorus

\beginverse
And I kno\[E]w
I may \[F#m]end \[G#m]up \[A]fai\[C#]ling to\[D]o
But I kno\[E]w
You were \[C#]just like me with someone disappointed in you
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F#m]I've become so \[D]numb
I can't feel you \[A]there
Become so \[E]tired
So much more a\[F#m]ware
I'm becoming \[D]this
All I want to \[A]do
Is be more like \[E]me
And be less like \[F#m]you
\endchorus

\beginchorus
\[F#m]I've become so \[D]numb
I can't feel you \[A]there
I'm tired of being what you wa\[E]nt me to be
\[F#m]I've become so \[D]numb
I can't feel you \[A]there
I'm tired of being what you wa\[E]nt me to be
