\beginverse
\[C]Call you up in the middle of the night
\[Em]Like a firefly without a light
\[Am]You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
\[G]I was a key that could use a little turnin'
\endverse

\[C]So tired that I couldn't even sleep
\[Em]So many secrets I couldn't keep
\[Am]Promised myself I wouldn't weep
\[G]One more promise I couldn't keep
\endverse
 
\beginverse
It \[F]seems no one can \[G]help me now
I'm \[C]in too deep, there's \[Am]no way out
\[F]This time I have \[Em]really led my\[G]self astray \[G]~ 
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Runaway train never going back
\[Em]Wrong way on a one-way track
\[Am]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
\[G]Somehow I'm neither here nor there
\endchorus 

\beginverse
\[C]Can you help me remember how to smile
\[Em]Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
\[Am]How on earth did I get so jaded
\[G]Life's mysteries seem so faded
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]I can go where no one else can go
\[Em]I know what no one else knows
\[Am]Here I am just drowning in the rain
\[G]With a ticket for a runaway train
\endverse
 
\beginverse
And \[F]everything seems \[G]cut and dry
\[C]Day and night, \[Am]earth and sky
\[F]Somehow I \[Em]just don't be\[G]lieve it
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Bought a ticket for a runaway train
\[Em]Like a madman laughing at the rain
